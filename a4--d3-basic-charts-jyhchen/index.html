            Zac Lowther's Fun 2021 Season

        <p>
            This will look into some pitch metrics and tendancies of Zac Lowther during his outings in the 2021 MLB Season. Data pulled from
            <a href='https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search?hfPT=&hfAB=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfZ=&stadium=&hfBBL=&hfNewZones=&hfPull=&hfC=&hfSea=2021%7C&hfSit=&player_type=pitcher&hfOuts=&opponent=&pitcher_throws=&batter_stands=&hfSA=&game_date_gt=&game_date_lt=&hfInfield=&team=&position=&hfOutfield=&hfRO=&home_road=&hfFlag=&hfBBT=&pitchers_lookup%5B%5D=675912&metric_1=&hfInn=&min_pitches=0&min_results=0&group_by=name&sort_col=pitches&player_event_sort=api_p_release_speed&sort_order=desc&min_pas=0#results'>

            </a> and later wrangled and spliced with Python.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Lowther fastball velocity by inning:
        </h3>

        <!-- Visualization goes here -->
        <div class='vis-holder' id='vis1'></div>
        <p>
            It can be seen that Lowther does have some minor fluctuations in his fastball averages per inning. During his starts, he tends to lose some velocity around the third and fourth innings. The spike in later innings is from his relief outings, where Lowther
            is only in charge of one or two later innings and doesn't have to pace himself for five or six innings as a starter.
        </p>
        <p>
            This quantitative data is shown in a line chart to be able to easily see how the fastball velocities trend up or down from inning-to-inning. It plots the ordered key value (innings) against a quantitative value (velocity).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Lowther pitch breakdown by appearance:
        </h3>

        <!-- Visualization goes here -->
        <div class='vis-holder' id='vis2'></div>

        <p>This grouped bar chart shows Lowther's pitch usage in every of his appearances. It can be seen that he is a fastball/changeup heavy pitcher.</p>
        <p>This categorical data is shown in this chart since it is able to break down each group (pitch types) for each subgroup (Lowther's outings). It allows easy comparison for how often a pitch is used. The categorical keys are pitch type and outing
            and the quantitative value is the pitch count.
        </p>
